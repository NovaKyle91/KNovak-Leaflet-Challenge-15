# KNovak-Leaflet-Challenge-15

## Hello and Thank You for taking the time to review my Leaflet Challenge!
You can find the index.html code in the folder labeled KNOVAK Leaflet Challenge 15. Within that folder you can open the static folder, from there you will find style.css and logic.js files.

Please review my code, but also, I encourage you to open my html by right clicking anywhere within the index.html and clicking open with live server. There you will find a map of the United States with markers of different sizes that reflect the magnitude of recent earthquakes.

The static folder also has a folder labeled Kyle Images. Here you will find 2 screen grabs of the map of the U.S. as it appears when opening the HTML and an up close screen grab of California highlighting a pop up of an earthquake occurrence.

Please reach out if you have any questions.

Again, thank you for taking the time to review my work!

Cheers,
Kyle
